# Neural Networks

This directory contains neural network implementations using TensorFlow as well as custom implementations based on
NumPy. The focus is on understanding the fundamentals of neural networks and their practical application.

The examples cover both **dense** and **convolutional** neural networks.

Dense (fully connected) neural networks are used to
introduce core concepts such as forward propagation, backpropagation, activation functions, and optimization algorithms.
For this reason, these examples also include custom implementations based on NumPy.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used for more complex tasks, primarily image classification.

## Projects
